### Create File
This feature allows you to create a new file of a specific type (Python, Rust, Java, or JavaScript) by clicking on the respective button.

### Create Codespace
This feature allows you to create a new codespace by clicking on the "Create Codespace" button. A codespace is a collection of files and folders that you can open and work with in the Code Editor.

### Import Hard Codespace
This feature allows you to import a pre-existing directory into the Code Editor. When you import a hard codespace, all the file contents of the target directory will be copied into the Eagle item.

### Import Soft Codespace
This feature allows you to import a pre-existing directory into the Code Editor. When you import a soft codespace, the Code Editor will create a link to the target directory, allowing you to work with the files in their original location.
